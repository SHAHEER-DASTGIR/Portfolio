      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
        Electrical Engineer with a strong foundation in software development, embedded systems, and machine learning. I have hands-on experience in Python, Verilog, and UVM-SV with a passion for bridging low-level hardware design and high-level AI systems.

As a Research Assistant at Namal Universityâ€™s Big Data & AI Center, I contributed to RISC-V CPU design and MIPI core verification using industry-standard tools like Quest Asim and Gtkwave. My work integrates hardware and AI, focusing on innovation and efficiency.

I thrive in collaborative, research-driven environments and am continuously exploring new challenges in embedded systems, AI, and hardware verification.
